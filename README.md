## I want to flex...
- [my implementation of malloc and free](memalloc/bmalloc.c)
- [psuser - shows PID and command name of all process owned by a particular user](sysinfo/psuser.c)
- [my implementation of pstree](sysinfo/pstree.c)
- [psfile - shows all process that have a particular file open](sysinfo/psfile.c)
- [benchmark - test how long your disk take to create n random 1-byte files in random order and delete them in ascending order](filesystem/benchmark.c)
