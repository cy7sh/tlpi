Assume a system where the value returned by the call sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK) is
100. Assuming that the clock_t value returned by times() is an unsigned 32-bit
integer, how long will it take before this value cycles so that it restarts at 0? Perform
the same calculation for the CLOCKS_PER_SEC value returned by clock().

seconds = value / 100
value should be 4294967296 to overflow.
so the time required to overflow is 42949672.96 seconds.
