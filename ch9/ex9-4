If a process whose user IDs all have the value X executes a set-user-ID program
whose user ID, Y, is nonzero, then the process credentials are set as follows:
real=X effective=Y saved=Y

(We ignore the file-system user ID, since it tracks the effective user ID.) Show the
setuid(), seteuid(), setreuid(), and setresuid() calls, respectively, that would be used to
perform the following operations:

a) Suspend and resume the set-user-ID identity (i.e., switch the effective user
ID to the value of the real user ID and then back to the saved set-user-ID).

euid = geteuid();
seteuid(getuid());
seteuid(euid);

b) Permanently drop the set-user-ID identity (i.e., ensure that the effective
user ID and the saved set-user-ID are set to the value of the real user ID).

ruid = getuid();
setresuid(uid, uid, uid);
